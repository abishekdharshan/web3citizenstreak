# Web3 Citizen Streak

Welcome to **Web3 Citizen Streak**! 

Web3 Citizen Streak is an intuitive browser extension tailored for the dedicated 'web3 citizens'—those who immerse themselves in the decentralized digital realm daily. Recognizing the rapid evolution of the web3 ecosystem, our platform ensures users remain at the forefront of exploring innovative new dapps. Should a user's engagement wane, our intuitive system promptly introduces them to fresh, curated dapps, ensuring their streak remains unbroken. With a blend of simplicity and power, Web3 Citizen Streak is not just a tool — it's a companion for the modern web3 enthusiast.

## Initial Use-Case

The primary goal of this extension is to help users maintain a daily streak of interacting with web3 dapps. If a user doesn't interact with a dapp on a particular day, the extension will recommend new dapps for them to explore, ensuring they keep up with their streak.

## Features

- **Streak Tracking**: Keep track of your daily web3 dapp interactions.
- **Dapp Recommendations**: Get suggestions for new dapps to explore if you're about to break your streak.
- **WalletConnect Integration**: Seamlessly connect your crypto wallet to interact with dapps.

## Intended Future Features

- **Enhanced WalletConnect Experience**: Improve the WalletConnecting experience with support for multiple connected wallets simultaneously.
  
- **Zerion API Integration**: Integrate with Zerion API for portfolio history, token, and NFT tracking support.
  
- **Automated Dapp Discovery**: Automate the dapp discovery and recommendation process. Receive push notifications when your streak timer is about to expire.
  
- **Browser Injection Functionality**: Inspired by [Chainstalker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chainstalker/oaldkgghifhdiamjlnihlaclgapomggl), we aim to build similar functionality to inject a popup as users browse apps like Twitter. This will activate when users hover over a supported dapp or a user's wallet (e.g., an ENS like abishek.eth).
